Women often face unique challenges in war and refugee settings. In many conflicts, women are specifically targeted for violence, including sexual assault and rape. Women may also be separated from their families or forced to flee without them, leaving them at increased risk of exploitation and abuse.

In refugee settings, women and girls often have limited access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. They may also face discrimination and gender-based violence in the host community. Additionally, women are often responsible for caring for children and other family members, which can make it difficult for them to engage in activities outside the home.

Efforts to address the needs and rights of women in war and refugee settings must take into account these unique challenges and work to empower women and ensure that they have access to the resources and support they need to rebuild their lives. This includes providing access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities, as well as addressing gender-based violence and discrimination. It also involves working with communities to challenge harmful gender norms and promote gender equality.
